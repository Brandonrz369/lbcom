I am beyond impressed with the service I received from Brandon at LB computer help. He went above and beyond to find the perfect router for our office one that could prioritize our fax machine and phones-both of which are essential to our day-to-day operations since the new set up, we've already noticed a significant improvement and call quality. Brandon was incredibly easy to work with and demonstrated a deep knowledge of IT systems. His professionalism and expertise made the whole process seamless. I will definitely be recommending him for any and all IT services in the future, highly recommend!!

As a boutique law firm handling sensitive client information daily, finding reliable IT support is critical to our operations. When we experienced a catastrophic server failure that threatened access to case files before a major trial, we contacted LB Computer Help based on a colleague's recommendation.

Brandon Ruiz responded immediately, arriving on-site within two hours of our call. His diagnostic process was methodical and transparent. Rather than rushing to solutions, he thoroughly assessed our infrastructure, identified multiple issues beyond the immediate server problem, and presented a comprehensive recovery plan with clear timelines and costs.

What impressed us most was Brandon's understanding of our specific needs as a law firm:

- He prioritized data confidentiality throughout the recovery process
- He worked after hours to minimize disruption to our case preparation
- He implemented additional backup systems to prevent future emergencies
- He provided clear documentation of all work performed for our compliance records

The recovery was completed ahead of schedule, allowing our legal team to access critical documents well before our court deadline. Brandon also identified and resolved several security vulnerabilities that our previous IT provider had overlooked.

Since this emergency, we've retained LB Computer Help for all our technical needs. Brandon's combination of technical expertise, professionalism, and understanding of a law firm's unique requirements has proven invaluable. We highly recommend LB Computer Help to any professional services firm that cannot afford technology failures or data breaches.

Fantastic help! Business needed to map a network drive, phone systems wouldn‚Äôt work, and attempted to create a drive pool but was not what was recommended.

What took me what I tried for days took Brandon under an hour!

Brandon Ruiz was super kind and helpful! He was able to fix my printer issues which I was having for about 3 weeks in just 30 minutes! I tried contacting HP support before reaching out but they weren‚Äôt very helpful, Brandon not only was super helpful but also walked me through the process so I can fix it on my own next time! 10/10 recommend!

Amazing service! This guy guided me through everything. I was about to spend my money with Geek Squad but if you want reasonable price. Do not waste your time going to Best Buy getting your computer fixed. This is the place you want to go to.

I was looking for a keyboard cleaning service for my MacBook Pro, which had a loose key that had become partly detached as well. A service request was sent to various businesses, and I found that Brandon from LB Computer Help provided the most thorough estimate breakdown and the most friendly communication. I didn't personally mind making the drive to Long Beach from Westminster since I wanted to support a small business, and Brandon did not disappoint! He went above and beyond to ensure that I was fully satisfied, removing the keys to do a deep cleaning, and had even gone out of his way to obtain a new key from a local shop to replace the broken one I had for same-day service. Additionally, he was able to drop off my laptop to me at a spot in Westminster later that afternoon. My keyboard looks and feels brand new! I'm appreciative of his efforts and I can't recommend him highly enough. Look no further because Brandon's your guy for computer assistance! Thanks a lot!

Requested service to restore my laptop once it was frozen when I clicked on a site. Brandon serviced my computer in less than an hour and I was up and running. His fee was reasonable and he actually helped me on another minor issue. I highly recommend him for his service
