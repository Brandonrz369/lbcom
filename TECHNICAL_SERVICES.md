### Diagnostic Processes

Our systematic diagnostic approach identifies both hardware and software issues with precision:

1. **Initial Assessment Protocol**

   - Hardware identification and verification via system information tools (CPU-Z, HWiNFO)
   - Event log analysis using Windows Event Viewer or Linux system logs
   - Resource utilization monitoring through Process Explorer/Activity Monitor
   - Component stress testing via Prime95, FurMark, and MemTest86+
   - Audio-visual error code interpretation (POST beep codes, LED patterns)

2. **Performance Diagnostics**
   - Baseline establishment using PCMark and 3DMark benchmarks
   - I/O performance testing with CrystalDiskMark
   - Thermal analysis with HWMonitor for identifying cooling issues
   - Power delivery testing using PSU-specific diagnostic tools
   - Boot time analysis and startup optimization
